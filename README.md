## Daniel Rose • Physics (MPhys) First Class • University of Southampton

I am an innovative and passionate problem solver who thrives in a buzzing, creative, and fast-paced team environment. Possessing a range of technical and business experience across a variety of disciplines, I excel at translating problems posed by non-technical colleagues and implementing strategic solutions. I am autonomously excellent and truly care about the quality of my work, while still being deadline driven with strong organisational skills and the ability to prioritise tasks effectively. I find collaboration with colleagues and cross-departmental teams comes naturally to me, as I genuinely enjoy working with and supporting others.

Received the award for the Best Masters Project across the entire MPhys course (University of Southampton 2018/19).
